The Copper River in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve (WRST) contains a high density of nesting Bald Eagles in interior Alaska; accordingly, the National Park Service identified Bald Eagles as a focal fauna species to monitor. Bald Eagles in WRST are a high profile species that are dependent upon many resources along the Copper River and are ecologically interesting because they nest at the northern edge of the species range. Bald Eagles are top-trophic level predators and they often respond quickly to changes in their environment by changing their breeding activities. In `r SurveyYear` we conducted an aerial bald eagle productivity survey in and around the park. Methods followed Putera J. and Miller S.D., 2018. Occupancy surveys were flown from `r GetLongDate(DatesDF$MinOccupancySurveyDate)` to `r GetLongDate(DatesDF$MaxOccupancySurveyDate)`, followed by productivity surveys from `r GetLongDate(DatesDF$MinProductivitySurveyDate)` to `r GetLongDate(DatesDF$MaxProductivitySurveyDate)`. We observed `r CurrentSummaryDF$'Nests located'` nests, of which `r CurrentSummaryDF$'Occupied'` were occupied (`r CurrentSummaryDF$'Occupied'/CurrentSummaryDF$'Nests located' * 100`%). Productivity surveys recorded `r CurrentSummaryDF$'Successful'` nests produced young (`r CurrentSummaryDF$'Successful'/CurrentSummaryDF$'Occupied' * 100`% of occupied nests). Successful nests resulted in `r CurrentSummaryDF$'Young fledged'` young, an average of `r CurrentSummaryDF$'Young/successful nest'` young per nest. `r CurrentSummaryDF$NestsNotFound_P` nests were not found., and `r CurrentSummaryDF$NestsNotCounted` were not counted.

# Introduction

The Copper River in WRST contains a high density of nesting Bald Eagles in interior Alaska; accordingly, the National Park Service identified Bald Eagles as a focal fauna species to monitor in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve (WRST). Bald Eagles in WRST are a high profile species that are dependent upon many resources along the Copper River and are ecologically interesting because they nest at the northern edge of the species range. Bald Eagles are top-trophic level predators and they often respond quickly to changes in their environment by changing their breeding activities. Further, Bald Eagles nesting along the Copper River in WRST may face increasing disturbance due to forestry activities and increased human visitation.

Bald eagles (*Haliaeetus leucocephalus*) are common breeders in Wrangell-St Elias National Park and Preserve (WRST). Most nests are concentrated along the Copper River and its major tributaries. Potential threats to nesting eagles include habitat loss, human disturbance, and exposure to environmental contaminants that may affect reproduction or survival. Specific threats include highway construction from Chitina to Cordova, development and timber harvest on private lands along rivers, lakes, and coastal areas, potential increases in commercial and recreational fishing on the Copper River and its tributaries, camping or other recreational or subsistence access/use activities (including use of ATVs and jet boats) in sensitive breeding areas, and environmental contamination from local and global sources. Pollution is of special concern in the wake of the Exxon-Valdez oil spill that occurred near Valdez in March of 1989. The TransAlaska Pipeline crosses three tributaries of the Copper River---the Gulkana, Tazlina, and Klutina rivers. These rivers are also crossed by the Richardson Highway, which is heavily used by tanker trucks carrying petroleum products to and from the Valdez terminal. These are all important reasons to document long-term trends on population density and reproductive rates for bald eagles.

# Objectives

The objectives of the monitoring efforts are to:

-   Document the annual changes in occupancy of bald eagles,

-   Document the annual changes in productivity of bald eagle nests, and

-   Document any changes in distribution of bald eagle nests.

# Methods

## Study Area

Five survey areas were defined along major riverways, and are described in Kozie (1996):

1.) The Upper Copper River (UCR, 80km) extends from Copper and Tanada lakes to the confluence of the Chistochina River. White spruce (Picea glauca) is the predominant tree species, with balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) common on the lower stretches. The Middle Copper River (MCR, 179km) extends from the Chistochina River south to the confluence of the Chitina River.

2.) The Middle Copper River (MCR) contains a mixture of both white spruce and balsam poplar, with poplar being slightly more common. The Copper River begins to braid along the MCR.

2.) The Lower Copper River (LCR) section (188km) extends from the Chitina River south to Miles Lake. The LCR is dominated by cottonwood along the river. The vegetation also begins to exhibit coastal influences, adding several coastal species including black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), and mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana). The Copper River is wide and more braided than the upper sections, with steep canyons on either side. Nesting begins consistently later along the LCR and is probably influenced by the numerous glaciers in the area which delay snow melt and maintain the area in a winter-like state several weeks after green up has begun to occur to the north.

3.) The Bremner River (45km) is surveyed from its confluence with the Copper River to the forks by Threemile Canyon, and has similar characteristics as the LCR.

4.) The Chitina River (116km) is surveyed from the confluence of the Copper River to where the river becomes braided above the Tana River. White spruce dominate the trees, with cottonwood becoming scarce in the upper reaches.

A total of 609 km of riverways are surveyed annually, amounting to over 1200km of surveys.

## Surveys

Two aerial surveys were conducted---one to document territorial occupancy, and one to document productivity. Surveys were flown using a small airplane flying at low level (\<100m AGL) and low speed (\<100 kph), with one experienced observer. Flight paths followed the river's edge, with the opposite side covered on the return trip. In most cases, the relatively narrow riparian corridor allowed adequate coverage with a single pass on each side of the river. Where the corridor widened, multiple passes were made to adequately evaluate the available habitat.

For all new nests located, the following information was collected:

a)  Location (latitude/longitude via handheld Global Positioning System receiver),
b)  Count of adult birds,
c)  Behavior of adults (incubating, perched),
d)  Number of eggs observed,
e)  Number of nestlings,
f)  Species of nest tree (Populus spp., Picea spp.),
g)  Whether the nest tree was alive or dead, and
h)  Nest status (good, poor, remnant, gone).

All information except latitude/longitude was recorded on field forms. All nests still intact from the previous year's surveys were checked for occupancy during the occupancy survey. Information recorded for located nests include:

a)  Count of adult birds,
b)  Behavior of adults, and
c)  Number of eggs or nestlings observed.

During the second survey, all nest locations collected during prior surveys were checked for productivity. Territorial occupancy was defined based on a bird in the nest in incubating posture or two adult birds at a nest or in the nest tree (Postupalsky 1974). For the productivity survey, all nests observed with an incubating bird or two adult birds at a nest during the occupancy survey were checked to determine nest outcome. Multiple passes were commonly needed to count chicks, particularly in the Lower Copper area where cottonwoods are more common, and leaves make counting chicks difficult.
